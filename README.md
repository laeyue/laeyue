# Hey, I'm laeyue ðŸ‘‹

I like to vibe with code and figure things out as I go. Not a hardcore developerâ€”just someone who enjoys messing around with C, C++, Python, and Java.

### What Iâ€™ve Done:
- Made a Minecraft plugin (CustomDiscs-SVC) for my server. Didnâ€™t publish it, but it worked!
- Tinker with networking stuff and spin up virtual machinesâ€”Oracle, Google Cloud, AWS and Azure
- Usually breaking stuff and (sometimes) fixing it.
- Planning a home lab.
