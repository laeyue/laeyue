# Hey, I'm laeyue ðŸ‘‹

I like to vibe with code and figure things out as I go. Not a hardcore developerâ€”just someone who enjoys messing around with C, C++, Python, and Java. AI in coding? Super cool. Always looking for new ways to make tech do the heavy lifting.

### What Iâ€™ve Done:
- Made a Minecraft plugin (CustomDiscs-SVC) for my server. Didnâ€™t publish it, but it worked!
- Tinker with networking stuff and spin up virtual machinesâ€”Oracle, Google Cloud, AWS, you name it.
- Usually breaking stuff and (sometimes) fixing it.
- Planning a home lab, because why not?

If you like coding, AI, networks, or just messing with tech for fun, hit me up.  
Iâ€™ll probably be trying out something random anyway.
